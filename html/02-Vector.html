  <h1>Vectors and Lines</h1>
<p>This unit covers the following ideas. In preparation
  for the quiz and exam, make sure you have a lesson plan
  containing examples that explain and illustrate the following
  concepts.
</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Define, draw, and explain what a vector is in 2 and 3
    dimensions.</li>

    <li>Add, subtract, multiply (scalar, dot product, cross
    product) vectors. Be able to illustrate each operation
    geometrically.</li>

    <li>Use vector products to find angles, length, area,
    projections, and work.</li>

    <li>Use vectors to give equations of lines and planes, and be
    able to draw lines and planes in 3D.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Learning to work with vectors will be
  key tool we need for our work in high dimensions. Let's start
  with some problems related to finding distance in 3D, drawing in
  3D, and then we'll be ready to work with vectors.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    To find the distance between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and
    $(x_2,y_2)$ in the plane, we create a triangle connecting the
    two points. The base of the triangle has length $\Delta
    x=(x_2-x_1)$ and the vertical side has length $\Delta
    y=(y_2-y_1)$. The Pythagorean theorem gives us the distance
    between the two points as $\sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta
    y^2}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$. Show that the distance
    between two points $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2,z_2)$ in
    3-dimensions is $\sqrt{\Delta x^2+\Delta y^2+\Delta
    z^2}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2+(z_2-z_1)^2}$.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <span class="marginpar bmw">See 12.1:41-58.</span>
    Find the distance between the two points $P=(2,3,-4)$ and
    $Q=(0,-1,1)$. Then find an equation of the sphere passing
    though point $Q$ whose center is at $P$.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <span class="marginpar bmw">See 12.1:1-40.</span>
    For each of the following, construct a rough sketch of
    the set of points in space (3D) satisfying:

    <ol>
      <li>$2\leq z\leq 5$</li>

      <li>$x=2,y=3$</li>

      <li>$x^2+y^2+z^2=25$</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div class="definition">
    A vector is a magnitude in a certain direction. If $P$ and $Q$
    are points, then the vector $\vec{PQ}$ is the directed line
    segment from $P$ to $Q$. This definition holds in 1D, 2D, 3D,
    and beyond. If $V=(v_1,v_2,v_3)$ is a point in space, then to
    talk about the vector $\vec v$ from the origin $O$ to $V$ we'll
    use any of the following notations: $$\vec v =
    \vec{OV}=\left&lt;v_1,v_2,v_3\right&gt; = v_1{\bf i}+v_2{\bf
    j}+v_3{\bf k} = (v_1,v_2,v_3) = \begin{pmatrix}
      v_1\\ v_2\\ v_3\end{pmatrix}.$$
    The entries of the vector are called the $x$, $y$,
    and $z$ components of the vector.
  </div>

  <p>Note that $(v_1,v_2,v_3)$ could refer to either the point
  $V$ or the vector $\vec v$. The context of the problem we are
  working on will help us know if we are dealing with a point or a
  vector.</p>
  
  <div class="definition">
    Let $\mathbb{R}$ represent the set real numbers. Real numbers
    are actually 1D vectors. Let $\mathbb{R}^2$ represent the set
    of vectors $(x_1,x_2)$ in the plane. Let $\mathbb{R}^3$
    represent the set of vectors $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ in space. There's
    no reason to stop at 3, so let $\mathbb{R}^n$ represent the set
    of vectors $(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ in $n$ dimensions.
  </div>

  <p>In first semester calculus and before, most of our work
  dealt with problem in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$. Most of
  our work now will involve problems in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and
  $\mathbb{R}^3$. We've got to learn to visualize in
  $\mathbb{R}^3$.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    The magnitude, or length, or norm of a vector $\vec v =
    \left&lt;v_1,v_2,v_3\right&gt;$ is $|\vec v| =
    \sqrt{v_1^2+v_2^2+v_3^2}$. It is just the distance from the
    point $(v_1,v_2,v_3)$ to the origin. A unit vector is a vector
    whose length is one unit. The standard unit vectors are ${\bf
    i}=\left&lt;1,0,0\right&gt;$, ${\bf
    j}=\left&lt;0,1,0\right&gt;$, ${\bf
    k}=\left&lt;0,0,1\right&gt;$.
  </div>

  <p>Note that in 1D, the length of the vector
  $\left&lt;-2\right&gt;$ is simply $|-2|=\sqrt{(-2)^2}=2$, the
  distance to 0. Our use of the absolute value symbols is
  appropriate, as it generalizes the concept of absolute value
  (distance to zero) to all dimensions.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    Suppose $\vec x=\left&lt;x_1,x_2,x_3\right&gt;$ and $\vec
    y=\left&lt;y_1,y_2,y_3\right&gt;$ are two vectors in 3D, and
    $c$ is a real number. We define vector addition and scalar
    multiplication as follows:

    <ul>
      <li>Vector addition: $\vec x+\vec y =
      (x_1+y_1,x_2+y_2,x_3+y_3)$ (add component-wise).</li>

      <li>Scalar multiplication: $c\vec x = (cx_1,cx_2,cx_3)$.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <span class="marginpar bmw">See 12.2:23-24.</span>
    Consider the vectors $\vec u=(1,2)$ and $\vec
    v=\left&lt;3,1\right&gt;$. Draw $\vec u$, $\vec v$, $\vec
    u+\vec v$, and $\vec u-\vec v$ with their tail placed at the
    origin. Then draw $\vec v$ with its tail at the head of $\vec
    u$.
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See 11.1: 3,4.</div>
    Consider the vector $\vec v=(3,-1)$. Draw $\vec v$,
    $-\vec v$, and $3\vec v$. Suppose a donkey travels along the
    path given by $(x,y)=\vec v t = (3t,-t)$, where $t$ represents
    time. Draw the path followed by the donkey. Where is the donkey
    at time $t=0,1,2$? Put markers on your graph to show the
    donkey's location. Then determine how fast the donkey is
    traveling.
  </div>
  <p>In the previous problem you encountered $(x,y)=(3t,-t)$.
  This is an example of a function where the input is $t$ and the
  output is a vector $(x,y)$. For each input $t$, you get a single
  vector output $(x,y)$. Such a function is called a
  parametrization of the donkey's path. Because the output is a
  vector, we call the function a vector-valued function. Often,
  we'll use the variable $\vec r$ to represent the radial vector
  $(x,y)$, or $(x,y,z)$ in 3D. So we could rewrite the position of
  the donkey as $\vec r(t)=(3,-1)t$. We use $\vec r$ instead of $r$
  to remind us that the output is a vector.</p>
  <div class="problem" id="horse-line">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See 12.2: 1.</div>
    Suppose a horse races down a path given by the
    vector-valued function $\vec r(t) = (1,2)t+(3,4)$. (Remember
    this is the same as writing $(x,y) = (1,2)t+(3,4)$ or similarly
    $(x,y)=(1t+3,2t+4)$.) Where is the horse at time $t=0,1,2$? Put
    markers on your graph to show the horse's location. Draw the
    path followed by the horse. Give a unit vector that tells the
    horse's direction. Then determine how fast the horse is
    traveling.

    Write a vector equation $(x,y,z)=(?,?,?)$ for the line that
    passes through the point $P$ and is parallel to $\vec v$.
    [Hint, study <a href="#horse-line">the horse race problem</a>, and base your work off
    of what you saw there. It's almost identical.] Then generalize
    your work to give an equation of the line that passes through
    the point $P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and is parallel to the vector $\vec

  <p>Make sure you ask me in class to show you how to connect

  middle school. If you can remember $y=mx+b$, then you can quickly
  remember the equation of a line. If I don't show you in class,
  make sure you ask me (or feel free to come by early and ask
  before class).</p>

  <h1>The Dot Product</h1>
  <p>Now that we've learned how to add and
  subtract vectors, stretch them by scalars, and use them to find
  lines, it's time to introduce a way of multiplying vectors called
  the dot product. We'll use the dot product to help us find find
  angles. First, we need to recall the law of cosines.</p>

  <div class="theorem"> <span class="title">The Law of
  Cosines</span>
    
    <p>Consider a triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$. Let
    $\theta$ be the angle between the sides of length $a$ and $b$.
    Then the law of cosines states that
    $$c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos\theta.$$ If $\theta=90^\circ$, then
    $\cos\theta=0$ and this reduces to the Pythagorean theorem.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="definition"><span class="label">The Dot Product</span>
    If $\vec u = (u_1,u_2,u_3)$ and $\vec v= (v_1,v_2,v_3)$ are
    vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$, then we define the dot product of
    these two vectors to be $$\vec u\cdot \vec v = u_1 v_1+ u_2
    v_2+ u_3 v_3.$$ A similar definition holds for vectors in
    $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $\vec u\cdot \vec v = u_1 v_1+ u_2
    v_2+\cdots+ u_n v_n.$ You just multiply corresponding
    components together and then add. It is the same process used
    in matrix multiplication.

  <h2 id="work-section">Projections and Work</h2>
  <p>Suppose a heavy
  box needs to be lowered down a ramp. The box exerts a downward
  force of 200 Newtons, which we will write in vector notation as
  $\vec F=\left&lt;0,-200\right&gt;$. The ramp was placed so that
  the box needs to be moved right 6 m, and down 3 m, so we need to
  get from the origin $(0,0)$ to the point $(6,-3)$. This
  displacement can be written as $\vec d=\left&lt;6,-3\right&gt;$.
  The force $F$ acts straight down, which means the ramp takes some
  of the force. Our goal is to find out how much of the 200N the
  ramp takes, and how much force must be applied to prevent the box
  from sliding down the ramp (neglecting friction). We are going to
  break the force $\vec F$ into two components, one component in
  the direction of $\vec d$, and another component orthogonal to
  $\vec d$.</p>

  <div class="problem" id="force-intro">
    Read the preceding paragraph. We want to
    write $\vec F$ as the sum of two vectors $\vec F = \vec w+\vec
    n$, where $\vec w$ is parallel to $\vec d$ and $\vec n$ is
    orthogonal to $\vec d$. Since $\vec w$ is parallel to $\vec d$,
    we can write $\vec w=c\vec d$ for some unknown scalar $c$. This
    means that $\vec F=c\vec d+\vec n$. Use the fact that $\vec n$
    is orthogonal to $\vec d$ to solve for the unknown scalar $c$.
    [Hint: dot each side of $\vec F=c\vec d+\vec n$ with $\vec d$.
    This should turn the vectors into numbers, so you can use
    division.]
  </div>
  <p>The solution to the previous problem gives us the
  definition of a projection.</p>

  <div class="definition">
    The projection of $\vec F$ onto $\vec d$, written $\proj_{\vec
    d}\vec F$, is defined as $$\proj_{\vec d}\vec F =
    \left(\frac{\vec F\cdot \vec d}{\vec d\cdot \vec d}\right)\vec
    d.$$
  </div>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See 12.3:1-8 (part d).</div>
    Let $\vec u=(-1,2)$ and $\vec v=(3,4)$. Draw $\vec u,$
    $\vec v$, and $\proj_{\vec v}\vec u$. Then draw a line segment
    from the head of $\vec u$ to the head of the projection. Now
    let $\vec u=(-2,0)$ and keep $\vec v=(3,4)$. Draw $\vec u,$
    $\vec v$, and $\proj_{\vec v}\vec u$. Then draw a line segment
    from the head of $\vec u$ to the head of the projection.
  </div>
  <p>One final application of projections pertains to the
  concept of work. Work is the transfer of energy. If a force $F$
  acts through a displacement $d$, then the most basic definition
  of work is $W=Fd$, the product of the force and the displacement.
  This basic definition has a few assumptions.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The force $F$ must act in the same direction as the
    displacement.</li>

    <li>The force $F$ must be constant throughout the entire
    displacement.</li>

    <li>The displacement must be in a straight line.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Before the semester ends, we will be able to remove all 3 of
  these assumptions. The next problem will show you how dot
  products help us remove the first assumption. Recall the set up
  to <a href="#force-intro">this problem</a>. We want to lower a box down a ramp
  (which we will assume is frictionless). Gravity exerts a force of
  $\vec F=\left&lt;0,-200\right&gt;$ N. If we apply no other forces
  to this system, then gravity will do work on the box through a
  displacement of $\left&lt;6,-3\right&gt;$ m. The work done by
  gravity will transfer the potential energy of the box into
  kinetic energy (remember that work is a transfer of energy). How
  much energy is transferred?</p>

  <div class="problem" id="first-work-problem">
    <div class="marginpar bmw">See 12.3: 24, 41-44.</div>
    Find the amount of work done
    by the force $\vec F=\left&lt;0,-200\right&gt;$ through the
    displacement $\vec d=\left&lt;6,-3\right&gt;$. Find this by
    doing the following:

    <ol>
      <li>Find the projection of $\vec F$ onto $\vec d$. This tells
      you how much force acts in the direction of the displacement.
      Find the magnitude of this projection.</li>

      <li>Since work equals $W=Fd$, multiply your answer above by
      $|\vec {d}|$.</li>

      <li>Now compute $\vec F\cdot \vec d$. You have just shown
      that $W=\vec F\cdot \vec d$ when $\vec F$ and $\vec d$ are
      not in the same direction.</li>

  <h1>The Cross Product and Planes</h1>

  <p>The dot product gave us a
  way of multiplying two vectors together, but the result was a
  number, not a vectors. We now define the cross product, which
  will allow us to multiply two vectors together to give us another
  vector. We were able to define the dot product in all dimensions.
  The cross product is only defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</p>

  <div class="definition"><span class="label">The Cross Product</span>
    <span class="marginpar">
      This definition is not really a definition. It is actually a
      theorem. If you use the formula given as the definition, then
      you would need to prove the three facts. We have the tools to
      give a complete proof of (1) and (3), but we would need a
      course in linear algebra to prove (2). It shouldn't be too
      much of a surprise that the cross product is related to area,
      since it is defined in terms of determinants
    </span>
    
    The cross product of two vectors $\vec u =
    \left&lt;u_1,u_2,u_3\right&gt;$ and $\vec v =
    \left&lt;v_1,v_2,v_3\right&gt;$ is a new vector $\vec u\times
    \vec v$. This new vector is (1) orthogonal to both $\vec u$ and
    $\vec v$, (2) has a length equal to the area of the
    parallelogram whose sides are these two vectors, and (3) points
    in the direction your thumb points as you curl the base of your
    right hand from $\vec u$ to $\vec v$. The formula for the cross
    product is $$\vec u\times \vec v =

  <p>We will now combine the dot product with the cross product
  to develop an equation of a plane in 3D. Before doing so, let's
  look at what information we need to obtain a line in 2D, and a
  plane in 3D. To obtain a line in 2D, one way is to have 2 points.
  The next problem introduces the new idea by showing you how to
  find an equation of a line in 2D.</p>

  <div class="problem" id="plane-equation-normal-point">
    Suppose the point $P=(1,2)$ lies on line $L$. Suppose that the
    angle between the line and the vector $\vec
    n=\left&lt;3,4\right&gt;$ is 90$^\circ$ (whenever this happens we
    say the vector $\vec n$ is normal to the line). Let $Q=(x,y)$ be
    another point on the line $L$. Use the fact that $\vec n$ is
    orthogonal to $\vec {PQ}$ to obtain an equation of the line $L$.
